This directory contains different examples that show some features of `xsd-parser`. In addition to these examples you can also refer to the [unit test](./xsd-parser/tests/README.md), to have a more complete list of examples for the different features.

- `simple` - Probably the most simple example, at least, a starting point to understand `xsd-parser` or start more complex applications.
- `update_schema` - It demonstrates a more advanced use of the generator to create types from the schema with deserialization support enabled.
- `custom_names` - Short example that shows how to assign custom defined names to the generated types.
- `custom_naming` - Self-contained example that shows how to plug a custom `Naming` implementation into `Config::with_naming` to avoid name collisions.
- `custom_variants` - Similar to `custom_names`, this example shows how to assign custom names for enumeration variants.
- `custom_render_step` - Example that explains how to implement user defined render steps. This is useful if you want to generate additional structures from the already parsed and interpreted schema.
